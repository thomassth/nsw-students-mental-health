              The following questions ask how you have sought to cope with a
              hardship in your life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Read the statements and indicate how much you have been using each
              coping style.
            </p>
            <p>
              These items deal with ways you've been coping with the stress in
              your life since you found out you were going to have to have this
              operation.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are many ways to try to deal with problems.
            </p>
            <p>
              These items ask what you've been doing to cope with this one.
            </p>
            <p>
              Obviously, different people deal with things in different ways,
              but I'm interested in how you've tried to deal with it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each item says something about a particular way of coping.
            </p>
            <p>
              I want to know to what extent you've been doing what the item
              says. How much or how frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't answer on the basis of whether it seems to be working or
              notâ€”just whether or not you're doing it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Try to rate each item separately in your mind from the others.
            </p>
            <p>
              Make your answers as true FOR YOU as you can.
